Deliverables listed during the call for manning of last December 
\begin{enumerate}
\item \only<2>{\color{ta3chameleon}} Cross-machine L-Mode
  shoulder dependence on current both at constant B$_t$ and at
  constant $q_{95}$. Rationale: disentangle the effect of current and
  parallel connection length
\item \only<2>{\color{taorange}}Establish robust scenario for density
  shoulder profile in H-Mode and establish dependence on
  fuelling/neutral profiles/divertor conditioon
\item \only<2>{\color{ta3chameleon}}Use the new HHF probe on AUG to study
  filamentary transport under high-power H-Mode conditions \only<2>{\color{consorziored}}and under
  different plasma configurations (SN, DN)
\item \only<2>{\color{taorange}}Study the role of ELM regimes,  neutral
  compression and particle density in filamentary transport and
  related shoulder formation
\item \only<2>{\color{taorange}} Identify the contribution of
  collisionality and seeding on filamentary transport and related
  shoulder formation
\item \only<2>{\color{consorziored}}Determine the effect of filaments and
  shoulder formation on target heat loads in different H-mode plasmas
\end{enumerate}
\onslide<2>{
  So far H-Mode operation has been limited to AUG since no operational
  scenario in high-density NBH heated plasma on TCV has been established

    \begin{itemize}
      \item<1|only@1> AUG: All the shots were performed in the so-called
        Edge Optmized Configuration (EOC) shape. 
      \item<1|only@1> AUG: We matched correctly the shape and the L$_{\parallel}$
        here shown from outer divertor plate up to X-point 
      \item<2|only@2> AUG: The scan was performed with similar puffing
        rates for intermediate and higher current (0.8-1
        MA) whereas we reduced it at lower current to avoid early
        disruption
      \item<2|only@2> AUG: The total power (Ohmic plus NBI) was kept
        constant throughout the scan
      \item<2|only@2> AUG: We have comparable edge density, divertor neutral
        pressure and divertor temperature
      \item<3|only@3> TCV: We repeat the same excercise at TCV with a
        slight difference in the profile of parallel connection
        length. This required operation at unusual low toroidal field
        (up to 0.8T)
      \item<4|only@4> TCV: no additional heating
        has been used. Nevertheless the difference in power crossing the separatrix
        is small
      \item<4|only@4> TCV: The difference in target pressure similar
        to AUG behavior. 
      \item<5|only@5> AUG: At comparable edge density Upstream profiles are
        different with the tendency to develop shoulder easier at
        lower current. \alert{We have flattening of the upstream
          profiles only when $\Lambda_{div}$ is well above one on all
          the profile}
      \item<6|only@6> AUG: Neutrals estimated using calibrated D$_{\alpha}$
        cameras coupled with values of density and temperature at the
        target suggest a larger neutral density at lower current (even
        with comparable values of edge electron density)
      \item<7|only@7> AUG: At all the current a clear roll-over in
        peak density observed and we can also track the radiation
        front move away from target earlier in density at lower current
      \item<8|only@8> TCV: This tendency is not observed for TCV where
        profiles seem resilient to modification of Bt even though we
        reached pretty high value of $\Lambda_{div}$ all along the profile.
      \item<9|only@9> TCV: This is due to the fact that we can't
        observed during the density ramp any signature of rollover or detachment,
        \alert{whereas upstream profile modification at TCV are only observed
        well after rollover}
      \item<10|only@10> AUG: There is the tendency towards larger blobs
        at lower current at all values of $\Lambda_{div}$
      \item<11|only@11> AUG: This need to be further confirmed
        independently by GPI measurements. The present setup allows
        for space resolution of the order of mm with a 397 kframe/s
        sampling rate. Small amount of He gas flux needed ($\sim
        1.5e^{17} atoms/ms$)
      \item<12|only@12> TCV: this is not confirmed for TCV where blob
        sizes is rather constant over a rather large range of
        $\Lambda_{div}$. At the same time we do not observe target
        density rollover neither upstream profile flattening

%   \setbeamercovered{transparent}
%   \begin{enumerate}[<+(1) | invisible@-+>]
%     \item Experimental and theoretical investigations suggest that SOL density profiles are
%       determined by the balance between radial filamentary transport and parallel dynamics
%     \item The balance changes at high density and leads to broadened SOL density profiles $\rightarrow$ \emph{shoulder formation}
%     \item This is observed in L-mode plasmas in a variety of devices including AUG \parencite{Carralero:2014gs},
%       TCV \parencite{Garcia:2007p2615} and MAST \parencite{Militello:2016hk}
%     \item Observations exhibit various other dependencies e.g., divertor
%       collisionality, plasma current, seeding. \alert{Results from
%         different devices not fully reconciled and the underlying mechanism is not fully understood.}
%     \item Studies of shoulder formation in H-Mode are so far limited

% 		\end{enumerate}
% 		\item Probe head must be changed to allow
%                   investigation of both fast T$_e$ (BPP),  and T$_i$
%                   (RFEA) but this require careful schedule of machine time
% 	\end{itemize}

% \begin{frame}{COMPASS collaboration}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item COMPASS is not an MST1 device, therefore no operational cost
%   will be provided by MST1
% \item However GA agrees that MST1 can provide part of the ppy for
%   running experiments in line with MST1 topics
% \item Proposal \# 14 is focused filaments dynamics and shoulder
%   formation both in L and H-Mode
% \item Experimental plan can be therefore agreed in order to perform
%   similar experiments (e.g. I$_p$ and $q_{95}$ scan in L-Mode)
%   ensuring proper comparison between devices
% \item COMPASS suppose 3ppy for running and evaluation of experiment
%   pertaining Topic-21, among Czeck and other european laboratories.
% \end{itemize}
% \end{frame}

% \begin{frame}{There are urgent experiment which cannot be addressed}
% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item Detailed ion temp measurements. Must eventually be
%           completed in internal programs. Are you willing to share the
%           information among Topic 21 even though done internally?
% 	\item Topology investigations? For example the comparison
%           USN/LSN/DN is not included. Diagnostic capability of upper
%           divertor is weaker than the lower one.
%           Better to use reverse B$_t$  which is known
%           to have influences in detachment as
%           well \parencite{McLean}
% 	\item Strikepoint sweeping and cryo pump
% 	\item Parameters scans in H-mode
% 	\item X-point probes
% \end{itemize}
% \end{frame}

% \begin{frame}{Modeling require}
%   \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Mean field modeling, in particular for neutral investigation.
%       Available for AUG (EMC3-EIRENCE) and
%       MAST-U (SOLPS). So far we lack investigation for these scenario
%       targeting TCV. Manpower needed from edge and SOL modeling
%     \item Turbulence code: we should need self-consistent interaction
%       with neutrals. Possible tools \texttt{BOUT ++}, \texttt{HESEL},
%       \texttt{GBS}, \texttt{Tokam-3X}.
%       Some of them can be run by people who will, very
%       likely, apply for this topic, some other not
%   \end{enumerate}
% \end{frame}

% \begin{frame}{Future and Miscellaneous}
% 	\begin{itemize}
% 		\item Possibility to piggybag on
%                   Quiescent/small ELM H-mode shots (Topic 5,6, 18)
% 		\item Shortly after this meeting we will organize
%                   a follow-up meeting to reconcile ideas
%                   from this discussion (date not fixed yet)
% 		\item All information will be gathered on the wiki
%                 \item Other channels for discussion/sharing. e.g. Slack
%                   (mst1-topic21.slack.com), Github for code sharing, \ldots
% 		\item We aim to arrive to a proper shared database of
%                   filaments between the machines, where properties
%                   will be obtained using agreed approaches so that a
%                   cross-machine comparison paper could at the end be
%                   finalized at a certain point		
% 	\end{itemize}
% \end{frame}

% \begin{frame}{Discussion agenda}
% 	\begin{enumerate}
% 		\item Priorities. These are our personal ideas. Do we agree? 
% 		\item \underline{Common measurement techniques}. Filament
%                   properties, $\Lambda_{div}$ estimate and location,
%                   Neutrals, packing fraction, \ldots
