### KoM-AUG 03.03.2017

-   Antti Hakola: The first remark is the observation that TCV experiment crashes with the
    ITPA Div-SOL meeting. As a consequence **SC must check presence of
    relevant people otherwise ask for postponing the experiment**
-   Presentation of Experimental plan of D. Carralero:
    -   F. Militello suggest that q95 scan can provide as a consequence
        a changes of beta and consequently of the MHD activity. *Need to check
        of possible existing scenarios at different current*. In response to this remark Carralero remarks that there are 
	old shots where q95 and the plasma current were at the same level as proposed. In these shots no problems with MHD stability were observed.
    -   N. Walkden propose the development of synthetic diagnostic to compare
        with Probe and furthermore ask for the presence of GPI data
    -   Daniel: current GPI diagnostic can only measure in the very far SOL
    -   I. Cziegler comments on the improvement of GPI which in any case will not be
        available for the April campaign. The improved cameras at AUG will imply increased depth (Imaging closer to the LCFS)
    -   As Response to that A. Hakkola suggests for asking for contingency at the
        end of the campaign for GPI+ APD channels
    -   Carralero notes that the prelimenary measurements show good agreement with the old probehead which was further cross-validated with the LI-Bes diagnostic. 
-   Presentation of W. Zhang: density scan during ICRF heated plasmas. Can this be combined
    with existing scenario foreseen for H-Mode? Actually he proposed to scan heating at constant density
    -   Vianello notes that he had the impression that the presented experiments were moved to the internal program? *What is the conclusion?*
-   Presentation of K. McClements:
    -   Carralero: The request of collisionality scan to obtain different ELM sizes can be obtained as piggy back
        during the main experiment (density ramp)
    -   A fixed FILD (FILD2) diagnostic is available and can be operated during the campaign
    -   The SXR should be added as required diagnostic but in any case is routinely available
-   Presentation of J. Vicente
    -   The present setup is available only for density up to 3x10<sup>19</sup> band. *Is this sufficient for
        SOL exploration even at high density?*
    -   Proposed density steps rather then ramps. *Is this a real requirements in order to have reliable
        measurements?*
-   General remarks:
    -   Carralero: Changes of cryopumps require to schedule the shot as 1st shot of the day
    -   Bernert: Reversing the Bt should be done together with reverse of Ip (same helicity) so to be included
        in the campaign foreseen for November. *Is this a
        requirement even for 300 kW L-Mode plasmas?*
    -   J. Vicente asks if in a well established H-Mode we could think of a phase of discharge where a second
        null is brought into the vessel. Mathias commented that this would require a lot of development. *Can we
        attach a session leader to help us in designing the discharge?*
    -   F. Lagnner: Li-Beam operation is ensured and manned during the campaign. Profile and fluctuations are available at the
        same time
    -   Bernert: Bolometer/AXUV will be manned during the operation but analysis should be asked. *Can we find appropriate
        resources?*
    -   ECE/SXR for particle accelleration are a required diagnostic(provided by AUG staff). Routinely in operation but analysis
        should be asked. *Can CCFE people take care of these analysis?*
    -   Militello: notes that CCFE it starting up a ER project with clear synergies with the MST1 experiments under Topic 21	
    -   Antti Hakola stresses the importance of involving all external (non-AUG staff) actively in the experiment and utilize their skills.
    -   Antti Hakola: Due to the severe oversubscription to topic21, modeling was not prioritized this year, but funding for modeling might 
        be increase in 2018 where measurements are available.
