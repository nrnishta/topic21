## Minutes

### Participants
    
N. Vianello, V. Naulin, J. Rasmussen, A. Nielsen,
M. Agostini, M.Spolaore, C. Theiler,
F. Militello, D. Carralero, K. McClements, E. Seliunin, W. Wolfrum,
D. Briga, M. Komm, J. Adamek, A. Hakkola, J. Kovacic
    
### Presentation and questions
    
1.  N.Vianello
	-   W. Wolfrum point towards a better reference for 0.6 MA
	-   A. Nielsen suggests HESEL code for current scan
2.  M. Agostini:
	-   W. Wolfrum : not a line integrated measurement of the Stark Broadening
	-   F. Militello and D. Carralero: issues on temperatue estimate with
	very unlikely estimate of temeprature at the target
	-   D. Carralero: Molecular D2 from Eirene simulation which can't be seen from
	this type of analysis
3.  E. Seliunin
	-   F. Militello: poloidal location of the measurements and location of the fueling
	-   D. Carralero: Individual profiles and relation with the filaments. Are the single
	filaments affecting the profile reconstruction
4.  F. Militello
	-   D. Carralero: Charge Excahange to take into account the cooling of ion temperature
	but this can be also the method to cause clogging of filaments
5.  D. Carralero
	-   V. Naulin: question on the fact that power are going almost at 80 % in the ion channel.
	Need to check for LCFS location and inconsistency with simulation
    
### Action to be taken
    
-   [ ] Better evaluation of reference LiB profiles for 0.6 MA in AUG
-   [ ] Recomputation of density inversion from Stark-Broadening taking into account this is not a Line Integrated measurement
-   [ ] Evaluation of Amplitude vs Dalpha for AUG to compare with similar JET results
-   [ ] Statistical evaluation of Amplitude on TCV using homogeneous database
-   [ ] Combination of present Topic-21 experiment with past experiment on AUG in H-Mode
-   [ ] Evaluation of front-movement from Multispecral Imaging (MSI). Check which filter exists and if inversion is feasible
-   [ ] HESEL simulation during Ip scan for TCV and AUG
-   [ ] From HESEL can we get information on blob evolution with decreasing Ti due to higher CX losses from neutrals?
