**Available number of Shots #23**

### L-Mode: Forseen number 11

The reference shape is a LSN with a ion BxgradB pointing towards the X-point as in
\\#53514 @0.6s. Density ramp with Line average density from 3.5e19 to 8.2e19 Ip @ 240kA.
Plasma vertical position Z=+8cm to increase the SOL region in front of the probe

1.  Perform reference shot with 2 RCP stroke and SP sweeping for better coverage of target probe
2.  Repeat #1 with strokes at different timing
3.  Repeat #1 @ 160kA with stroke at the timing of maximum variation of the profiles according to #1-2
    keeing Bt constant
4.  Repeat #3 eventually reducing the Drate and repeat #3
5.  Repeat #1 @ 300kA with the same density ramp and strokes according to #3 keeping Bt constant
6.  Repeat #1 @ 300kA increasing the Drate up to Line average density of 9e19
7.  Repeat #1 with strokes according to best timing from #1-#2 but with Reverse Bt
8.  Drate from #1, Ip=240kA, Z=+23 strokes from #7
9.  Drate from #1, Ip=240kA, Z=-10 strokes from #7
10. Repeat #3 keeping q95 constant with respect to #1
11. Repeat #10 for diagnostic purpouse


### H-Mode: Forseen number 12

Reference shot for Type I ELMy H-Mode from TCV15-2.3-1 #53352 with Z=+8cm, still compatible
with NBI operation. The ELM frequency is 100Hz approximately

1.  Repeat #53352 with probe plunge in L and H-mode. Check robustness of Probe signal in H-mode, eventually adjust
    maximum insertion
2.  Repeat #53352 D2 density ramp once H-Mode is established.
3.  Check maximum density achieved before H-Mode degradation or disruption. Density feedback to
    this value during H-Mode. NBI power ramp down to check for ELMy regime
4.  Repeat #3 for diagnostic purpouse
5.  repeat #3 in the High-Density phase start N-seeding. Use seeding rate from Detachment experiment
    in L-Mode as starting point
6.  Evaluation of #6 in terms of divertor condition. Choose the right N-seeding values and repeat
7.  Repeat #6, anticipate the NBI power, keep density and N-seeding after the H-L transition. Plunge also in L-Mode
8.  Repeat #7 for diagnostic purpouse
9.  Repeat #8. If feasible decrease vertical position @ Z=-8cm
