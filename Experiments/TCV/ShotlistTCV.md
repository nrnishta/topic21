# TCV operational plan
**Available number of Shots #23**

## Calendar Week 24 (12.06-16.06)
### L-Mode
1.  Reference shot is #54867 I<sub>p</sub>=240 kA, q<sub>95</sub>=3.5, B<sub>t</sub> 1.41 T. Repeat straigth
2.  Repeat #1 with I<sub>_p</sub>=180 kA with the same q<sub>95</sub>=3.5 and adjusting the toroidal field
3.  Repeat #1 with I<sub>_p</sub>=300 kA with the same q<sub>95</sub>=3.5 and adjusting the toroidal field.
    _In case accidental Ohmic H-Mode repeat in Reverse Bt_
4.  Density ramp as in #2, I<sub>_p</sub>=180 kA, B<sub>t</sub> 1.41 T
5.  Density ramp as in #3, I<sub>_p</sub>=300 kA, B<sub>t</sub> 1.41 T
6.  Repeat density ramp of Shot #1 with Z=+23cm
7.  Repeat density ramp of Shot #1 with Z=-10cm
8.  Repeat density ramp of Shot #1 in DN configuration with I<sub>p</sub>=240 kA
9.  Repeat density ramp of Shot #1 in DN configuration with I<sub>p</sub>=180 kA
10. Repeat density ramp of Shot #1 in DN configuration with I<sub>p</sub>=300 kA
### H-Mode
11. Repeat #53352 same sentting. 1MW NBI power from 0.8 to 1.2 s. At 0.82 s starts a
    density ramp keeping the same rate as #1. At 1.2 second power ramp down for check ELMy regime
12. Repeat #11 adjusting the fueling accordingly. We include N seeding
13. Repeat #12 with best trade off between fueling and seeding


## Calendar Week 43 (23.10-27.10)
**To be decided according to results of week 24**
### Tentative
Reference shot for Type I ELMy H-Mode from TCV15-2.3-1 #53352 with Z=+8cm, still compatible
with NBI operation. The ELM frequency is 100Hz approximately

1.  Repeat #53352 with probe plunge in L and H-mode. Check robustness of Probe signal in H-mode, eventually adjust
    maximum insertion
2.  Repeat #53352 D2 density ramp once H-Mode is established.
3.  Check maximum density achieved before H-Mode degradation or disruption. Density feedback to
    this value during H-Mode. NBI power ramp down to check for ELMy regime
4.  Repeat #3 for diagnostic purpouse
5.  repeat #3 in the High-Density phase start N-seeding. Use seeding rate from Detachment experiment
    in L-Mode as starting point
6.  Evaluation of #6 in terms of divertor condition. Choose the right N-seeding values and repeat
7.  Repeat #6, anticipate the NBI power, keep density and N-seeding after the H-L transition. Plunge also in L-Mode
8.  Repeat #7 for diagnostic purpouse
9.  Repeat #8. If feasible decrease vertical position @ Z=-8cm
10. Contingency
