# MAST-U

Foreseen number of shots 13


<a id="org6ece957"></a>

## L-Mode: Foreseen 6 shots

1.  Density ramp at 400 kA on midplane manipulator up to density where shoulder will appear
    Fueling from the divertor common flux region
2.  Repeat #1 at 800kA with constant Bt
3.  Repeat #2 at 800kA with constant q95 with respect to #1
4.  Repeat #1 with fueling at upstream LFS
5.  Repeat #1 with RFA to get information on Ti
6.  Repeat #4 with RFA to get information for Ti

## H-Mode: Forseen 7 Shots

The H-Mode scenario need to be well developed and eventually this part may be
move to 2018 if scenario not found

1.  Type-I H mode with fueling increase in from the same location of #1 L-Mode plasma. Determine
    proper density value for broadening (if any)
2.  Repeat #1 at target density for broader profile for diagnostic purpose
3.  Repeat #1 keep density below threshold for broadening (if any). N seeding
4.  Determine optimum for N seeding to keep radiation in within the SOL (no X-point radiation)
    Is there any N seeding feedback foreseen?
5.  Repeat #1 at changing the connection length (e.g change of the gap between divertor baffle or moving from SN to DN)
6.  Repat #5 with seeding
7.  Contingency
