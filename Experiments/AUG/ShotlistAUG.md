# Shotlist for TOPIC 21: AUG

Available number of Shots allocated for the experiment is **14** split
up to now in two weeks (Calendar Week 15 and Calendar week 17). We 
propose the following shotlist for the two weeks which should accomodate the main 
topic proposed:
* L-Mode investigation with **Ip<sub>p</sub> scan** performed both with _constant_ and _variable_ q95
* H-Mode investigation with **High Power (up to 6 MW)**.
With the present proposal there should be room for including additional investigation 
in particular in L-Mode (less demanding scenario development)

## Week 17
### L-Mode: Bt/q95 scan

1.  Reference Shot @ 0.8 MA (e.g. #30269 **EOC shape**) with 0.5 MW NBI starting at
    the same time of fueling ramp
2.  Shot at q<sub>95</sub>=4.95 as #1, toroidal field B<sub>t</sub>=1.9T current to
    be determined
3.  Shot at q<sub>95</sub>=4.95 I<sub>p</sub>=1.1MA toroidal field accordingly chosen (approximately 3.5T). Still
    500 kW NBI, increase the fueling rate
4.  Shot with B<sub>t</sub>=2.5T, I<sub>p</sub> as #3
5.  Shot with B<sub>t</sub>=2.5T, I<sub>p</sub> as #2

### H-Mode: Scenario development
The reference shot is 33478 (AUG15-2.2-3) with the aim to reach the condition found in 31607 (Sun PPCF 2015)

1.  Repeat # 33478 with P<sub>NBI</sub> = 4MW with D<sub>2</sub> puffing from 4s
    reaching value of 40 10<sup>21</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> @ 6s.
    1 Plunge of probe head
	in a safe position. Monitoring with Infrared probe head
2.  Repeat #1 adding the N seeding in feed-forward. Adjust the power according to ELM frequency
    and probe behavior in #1

## Week 17
### H-Mode investigation: Foreseen number 9

1.  Repeat best H-Mode shot found in Week 15 1st Radial position of probe
2.  Repeat #1, different probe position
3.  Repeat #1, different probe position
4.  Repeat best H-Mode shot found in week 15 and reduce the cryopumps
5.  Repeat best H-Mode shot found in week 15 and puff from midplane
6.  Contingency
7.  Contingency

## Notes
So far we have 2 shot of contingency which need to be allocated accordingly to week 15
operation. In the following the priorities we give to contingency once the L-Mode and H-Mode 
program has been obtained

### L-mode
1. Reversing Bt direction and repeat one identical shot (e.g # 30269) to investigate
   the role of SOL flows in SOL shoulder formation and filamentary transport
2. DN discharge with similar density ramps as in reference. Possibly the two X-point should
   sit on the same flux surface

### H-Mode
1. Attempt a scenario similar to Topic-06 which will be performed later in time. See for example
   shot #29816 (Presented by T. Eich in the GPM) which is at even higher power (8 MW) or #25740
   which is actually in DN. If we choose for this we could actually compare with the priority 3 of L-Mode
   contingency
2. Reverse Bt operation. In this case the L-H treshold is different and we might end
   by careful adjusting the power into I-Mode scenario. **Are this scenario interesting for us?**


## Diagnostics

We must ensure reliable and manned (?) operation of the following diagnostics and identify people
responsible for the analysis
- [x] Midplane manipulator
- [ ] Li-Beam. _Are fluctuations available for this diagnostic and in case are available together with profiles?_
- [ ] FILD: fixed one to ensure
- [ ] Reflectometer. The operation at 2T suggested by Diogo can be obtained during the q<sub>95</sub> scan
- [ ] Divertor probes
- [ ] Camera for neutral analysis
- [ ] B.Geiger and D LoS with Abel inversion?
- [ ] Infrared (to monitor probe head)
- [ ] Divertor Bolometry
- [ ] AXUV in the divertor region
- [ ] RFA  #2
- [ ] Fast probe on the limited
- [ ] GPI

## To be done
- [ ] Check shape modification during current and q95 scan
- [ ] Check GPI operation with I. Cziegler
