# Shotlist for TOPIC 21: AUG

Available number of Shots allocated for the experiment is **14** split
up to now in two weeks (Calendar Week 15 and Calendar week 17). We 
propose the following shotlist for the two weeks which should accomodate the main 
topic proposed:
* L-Mode investigation with **Ip<sub>p</sub> scan** performed both with _constant_ and _variable_ q95
* H-Mode investigation with **High Power (up to 6 MW)**.
With the present proposal there should be room for including additional investigation 
in particular in L-Mode (less demanding scenario development)

## Week 15
### L-Mode: Ip/q95 scan

1.  Reference Shot @ 0.8 MA (e.g. #30276). Keeping the same Bt and adjusting the Fueling rate in
order to ensure long enough pulse perform a similar shot @ 0.6MA
2.  Repeat Shot #1 by keeping the same q<sub>95</sub> as reference
3.  Repeat Shot #30276 @ 1MA with the same toroidal field
4.  Repeat #3 by keeping the same q<sub>95</sub> as the reference

### H-Mode: Scenario development
The reference shot is 33059 (AUG15-2.2-3) with the aim to reach the condition found in 31607 (Sun PPCF 2015)

1.  Scenario development. Start from succesful shot 33059 (Total heating 3.1 MW),
    keep the probe head in a safe position (FAR SOL) increase the heating power (two steps to 4.5 and 6) up to 6 MW
    monitoring midplane probe by IR and Divertor through Langmuir.
2.  Repeat #1 Fueling ramps according to reference. Monitor of Divertor condition
3.  Repeat #2 adjusting eventually the fueling and N seeding ramp monitoring the Divertor condition

## Week 17
### H-Mode investigation: Foreseen number 9

1.  Repeat best H-Mode shot found in Week 15 1st Radial position of probe
2.  Repeat #1, different probe position
3.  Repeat #1, different probe position
4.  Contingency
5.  Contingency
6.  Contingency
7.  Contingency

## Notes
So far we have 4 shot of contingency which need to be allocated accordingly to week 15
operation. In the following the priorities we give to contingency once the L-Mode and H-Mode 
program has been obtained

### L-mode
1. Reversing Bt direction and repeat one identical shot (e.g # 30276) to investigate
   the role of SOL flows in SOL shoulder formation and filamentary transport
2. Strike point sweeping to check with similar observation in JET
3. DN discharge with similar density ramps as in reference. Possibly the two X-point should
   sit on the same flux surface

### H-Mode
1. Attempt a scenario similar to Topic-06 which will be performed later in time. See for example
   shot #29816 (Presented by T. Eich in the GPM) which is at even higher power (8 MW) or #25740
   which is actually in DN. If we choose for this we could actually compare with the priority 3 of L-Mode
   contingency
2. Reverse Bt operation. In this case the L-H treshold is different and we might end
   by careful adjusting the power into I-Mode scenario. **Are this scenario interesting for us?**
3. Strike point sweeping

## Diagnostics

We must ensure reliable and manned (?) operation of the following diagnostics and identify people
responsible for the analysis
- [x] Midplane manipulator
- [ ] Li-Beam. _Are fluctuations available for this diagnostic and in case are available together with profiles?_
- [ ] FILD: fixed one to ensure
- [ ] Reflectometer. The operation at 2T suggested by Diogo can be obtained during the q<sub>95</sub> scan
- [ ] Divertor probes
- [ ] Camera for neutral analysis
- [ ] B.Geiger and D LoS with Abel inversion?
- [ ] Infrared (to monitor probe head)
- [ ] Divertor Bolometry
- [ ] AXUV in the divertor region
